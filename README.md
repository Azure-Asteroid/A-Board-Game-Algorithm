# A-Board-Game-Algorithm
An A* algorithm for solving board games yatta yatta blah

HOW DOES IT WORK!?: Well, you are to run this program from the commad window or if your favorite editor allows you to input
command line arguments to the program you can do it from there. So first, you start up the "Board.java" code and input the 
size of the square board you want to play. For example a 4x4 a 5x5 etc. The game will start from there.

Info: This is just an old Java project I made a while back. Nothing special.
